### Quick start

Send an SMS to one of the numbers to get started.

UK - +447480776370

"INTRO" - Shows the help message with available commands.

"ADDR" - Shows your address

"BALANCE" - Shows your current balance and the Bitcoin price.

"SEND (amount 0.00123 or Â£1.23) to (Bitcoin address or phone number)" - Send Bitcoin


### Why

testbitcoin enables anyone to send and receive Bitcoin using any phone that can send SMS without the need for an app or internet connection.  Bitcoin is peer-to-peer electronic cash and the people that would benefit most may not have regular internet access.



### How it works

When the bot receives a message it checks the bitcoin full node for an address with a label matching the from number.  If no address exists it creates one.  If an address exists the balance can be checked or sent on to other addresses or phone numbers.
